### Data

The data for this project derives from 3 different open source databases that provide us with the 5 different data sets used. These include the "New York City Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices" from the [eia U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=emm_epmr_pte_y35ny_dpg&f=m), the "Per Capita Personal Consumption Expenditures: Total for New York (NYPCEPC) from the [Economic Research Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NYPCEPC), and the "Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions" from the [NYC Mayor's Office of Sustainability](https://nyc-ghg-inventory.cusp.nyu.edu). 

The NYC gas dataset provided by the eia, provides New York City's Regular all formulations retail gasoline prices in dollars per gallon. The dataset downloaded contains the price per gallon of every month from the year 2000 up to October 2021. The Per Capita Personal Consumption Expenditures dataset provides annual personal consumption expenditures of a given area divided by the resident population of the area, in this case the area being New York and the years provided from 1997 to 2020. The NYC GHG inventory provides us with the Citywide Inventory and City Government Inventory of GHG information. For this project I utilized the Citywide Inventory which consists of direct and indirect GHG emissions from- Stationary energy: energy used by buildings and other stationary sources, as well as fugitive emissions from natural gas distribution; Transportation: on-road transportation, railways, marine navigation, and aviation; and Waste: wastewater treatment, and solid waste generated - all within the city's boundaries. This inventory that provides us with these 3 datasets, contains emission data from the years 2005 to 2019 and with two metric units - GHG (tCOâ‚‚e) and Source Energy (MMBtu), for this project I used GHG.
