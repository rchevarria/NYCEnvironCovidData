## New York City's Environmental Footprint and COVID-19

### Introduction

People’s lives were disrupted by COVID-19, millions remained home for an
extended amount of time. This resulted in a pause of daily commutes, outdoor/indoor activities, 
reduced incomes, and consumerism. I want to use data analysis to see how this situation reduced 
New Yorker’s environmental footprint, and how future return to normalcy will impact these trends.

### Brief Description

This project seeks to view connections between NYC's inactivity/shutdown during the pandemic and 
its effect on the environment. To establish these connections I am using data bases pertaining to 
gas prices, stationary emissions, transportation emissions, waste emissions and per capita 
expenditures. Through the use of pandas, SQL, regex, matplotlib, and other python methods, I am 
able to portray these pieces of data in a meaningful way, in which they show connections to each 
other. 

### Relevance to NYC

This connects to NYC as it is a very dense city that was largely inactive due to the pandemic 
and the consequent shutdowns. As a big crowded city, New York's environmental footprint is large, 
therefore this period of time of closure likely had an effect. The data used in this project 
pertain's to NYC and seeks to highlight New Yorker's overall activity before and after the 
pandemic as well as the city's emission trends. 

### Visuals
