```
f_gas = pd.read_csv("NY_GasPrices.csv", skiprows=2)
df_gas = df_gas.iloc[:-1, :]    #Last empty row is dropped

#Creating Year Column
gas_year = []
for i in df_gas['Date']:
    gas_year.append(int(i[4:8]))

df_gas['Year'] = gas_year

#df_new will only contain the Year column and Gas prices, from 2016 to present
q_gas_1 = 'SELECT Year, "New York City Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices (Dollars per Gallon)" AS  GasPrices FROM df_gas WHERE Year >= 2016 and Year <= 2019'
gas = psql.sqldf(q_gas_1)
dfGas_Result = pd.DataFrame(gas)

#df_new will now be grouped by the year and the average price is computed for each year
q_2 = 'SELECT Year, AVG(GasPrices) as AvgGasPrices FROM dfGas_Result GROUP BY Year'
avgGas = psql.sqldf(q_2)
dfGas_Result = pd.DataFrame(avgGas)
